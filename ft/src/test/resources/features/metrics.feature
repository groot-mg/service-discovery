Feature: Checking metrics endpoints contains the expected metrics

  # Provided by StartupTimeMetricsListener
  Scenario: [startup metrics] When application is running, display start up metric content
    Given a private endpoint PRIVATE_METRICS is prepared
    When the request is sent
    Then the response status code should be 200
		And the response body contains:
			| application_ready_time_seconds   |
      | application_started_time_seconds |

  # Provided by SystemMetricsAutoConfiguration
  # UptimeMetrics, ProcessorMetrics, FileDescriptorMetrics, DiskSpaceMetricsBinder
  Scenario: [system metrics] When application is running, display system metric content
    Given a private endpoint PRIVATE_METRICS is prepared
    When the request is sent
    Then the response status code should be 200
